# ReVista Wordpress Theme

This theme builds on the Extra Wordpress theme. It is the new theme for ReVista: The Harvard Review of Latin America. ReVista was originally an OpenScholar hosted website,
but they wanted more variety in page layouts to distinguish different sections of the site, and wanted the ability to replicate layouts when necessary. Unfortunately,
OpenScholar does not have a clone feature, so we switched to Wordpress and implemented the new theme using Extra and Divi.
